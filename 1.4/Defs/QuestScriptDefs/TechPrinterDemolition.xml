			    <li>questDescription->We have received the news of a techprinter installation belonging to [empire_name] near our location. Techprinters are a huge environmental hazard, and are used by techfriars to replicate their knowledge on techprints.
\nTechite discs used in this process are extremely toxic and flammable. We might be able to ignite a stack of these discs and see the inferno unfold.
\nThe techprinter installation is protected by:
[forces_description].
\nTwo palintone turrets are located at the installation. They are powerful, anti-infantry weapons firing large-caliber shells at incredible speeds, dealing heavy damage over significant ranges. Their ammo needs to be stored right next to them, and a precise shot might set off a chain explosion.
\nWe have also been informed that the location is protected by a number of ground-mounted striker turrets. Despite the limited range, these turrets can easily reveal our approach and provide covering fire for the imperial army.
\nTwo techfriars are most certainly at the installation. Killing them is not necessary.
\nThe techprinter installation is protected by a number of surveillance pillars. They should not be approached, and instead should be disabled from afar - either by destroying them, or cutting off their power. Once activated, they will greatly increase our visibility.
\nThe objective of this assignment is to destroy the techprinters by any means necessary. Once that is done, the reward will arrive and we will have to make our escape.
\nOnce we arrive at the installation, we can expect an imperial response if our visibility is high enough. We will only have a limited amount of time to complete the mission.</li>
