                <li>questDescription->News of the recent assassination of [lastTarget_nameFull] has spread like wildfire across the nobility of [empire_name], fueling the flames of dissent and rebellion. Defectors, once seen as insignificant, have begun seizing victories on various fronts, rattling the gilded cage of the aristocracy. In the shadowy halls of the noble court, whispers stir the air, whispers of desperate bargains offered to the surging rebel forces.
\nIntriguingly, one such proposition has found its way to you. Envoys from the imperial court have dispatched an encrypted missive to [map_label]. In carefully coded language, they detail the bounty they're prepared to lavish upon you, should you choose to abandon your deserters' colors:
[reward_description]
\nIf you accept, you will no longer be aligned with the deserters. You will lose access to the Deserter network, and you will never be able to rejoin their ranks again. Your visibility will be lowered to 0 and you will become a member of [empire_name]. You will be able to use all the perks that come from being a noble. Any currently active deserter-related quests will automatically fail.
You will also have to face off against a deserter retaliation force, consisting of:
[raid/raidPawnKinds]
\nIt is possible, but not guaranteed, that the Empire will bargain with you again if you continue on your path. Next deals offered might be more bountiful.</li>
                <li>questDescription->The untimely demise of [lastTarget_nameFull] has sent shockwaves through the nobility of [empire_name], fanning the embers of dissent into a roaring blaze. What once were dismissed as trivial defections are now victorious battles on numerous fronts, shaking the once secure stronghold of the aristocracy. Amid the hushed murmurings of the noble court, whispers of frantic concessions offered to the rapidly rising rebel forces ripple through the air.
\nThis proposition is extended to you as well. Emissaries of the empire have dispatched a ciphered communique to [map_label], outlining the considerable benefits you stand to gain, should you decide to forsake the deserters.

                <li>questDescription->Word of [lastTarget_nameFull]'s sudden assassination has cast a chill across the noble circles of [empire_name], kindling a tempest of revolt and insubordination. Those who had once defected, dismissed as inconsequential, are now seizing key victories, causing a seismic shift in the power dynamics of the aristocracy. Secreted away in the labyrinthine depths of the court, rumors of hasty deals offered to the ever-strengthening rebellion echo eerily.
\nYou are not excluded from this tempting deal. Imperial ambassadors have transmitted a cryptic message to [map_label], shedding light on the incentives you stand to accrue if you abandon the deserters.

                <li>questDescription->The sudden and brutal assassination of [lastTarget_nameFull] has swept through the elite ranks of [empire_name], stoking the flames of insurrection and defiance. Defectors, once scorned as negligible, are achieving unexpected victories, shaking the seemingly impervious bastion of the nobility. In the shadowy corners of the court, murmurs of desperate alliances offered to the surging rebels snake through the air.
\nThis appealing bargain has also been presented to you. Envoys of the empire have forwarded a concealed missive to your outpost in [map_label], hinting at the boons you could acquire if you dissociate from the deserters.
