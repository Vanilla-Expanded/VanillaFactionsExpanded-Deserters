            <li>questDescription->[asker_nameFull], [asker_titleIndef], is calling from nearby. [asker_pronoun] has deserted the army of [asker_factionName] and is being hunted by (*Threat)a loyalty squad(/Threat). [asker_pronoun] wishes to join you at [map_definite].
\n[asker_nameDef] knows the location of key outpost containing everything needed to develop psychic powers:\n\n[sitePart1_itemStashContents]
\nBeware - If you accept [asker_nameDef], you will become an enemy of [asker_factionName]! The pursuing loyalty squad will attack immediately. It is composed of: \n\n[raid/raidPawnKinds]
\nOnly accept if you wish to fight against [asker_factionName] and develop your psycasters on your own. You will have one year to attack the outpost before it is moved.
\nPicking the side of the deserters will make the Empire permanently hostile, however it will also give you access to the Deserter network via the comms console. You will be able to gain intel on the Shattered Empire and trade this intel for powerful imperial gear, deserter inventions and new quests. At some point, you will be able to launch assassination missions on fanatic imperial figures in order to destabilize the empire.
\nIf you have a titled nobility under your control, they will lose all their titles, and with them, requirements for their titles. They will however generate a lump sum of intel for you, and the amount of intel depends on their current rank with Shattered Empire.</li>

\nSince you are aligned with the deserters, imperials will attack you on sight. This could however be an opportunity to deal a blow to the Empire when they are the most vulnerable.</li>
